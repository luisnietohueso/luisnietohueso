👋 Hi, I’m @luisnietohueso. My name is Luis Nieto Hueso and I'm excited to be a part of the Git-up community! I started learning code after I lost my job in the media industry, and now it has become my new passion. I'm currently enrolled in the Computer Science program at the University of Greenwich, where I'm eager to expand my knowledge of the world of computing and coding.

👀 I’m interested in all things related to technology, including web development, software engineering, and data science. I'm also interested in exploring new programming languages and frameworks to broaden my skills and knowledge.

🌱 I’m currently learning various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript,  and I'm also diving into web development with HTML, CSS. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me and allow me to work with others to build something meaningful. I'm eager to connect with other developers and learn from their experiences.

📫 How to reach me? You can connect with me on Git-up, and you can also reach me by email at luisnietohueso@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
